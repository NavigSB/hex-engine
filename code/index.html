      <h1>Welcome to the Hex Grid Builder!</h1>
      <p>
        This site was built as a starting point for a new virtual board game currently in
        development. The game will have a board with a hexagonal grid with a fixed number of rows
        and columns. The challenge then was to create a responsive board that will work on any
        sized screen so that mobile devices could participate with little more difficulty than any
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool aims at making this idea a reality, so it features a "screen" that responds
        appropriately to any window size. Feel free to let me know of any improvements that would
        make this more convenient!
      </p>

        All JS features used in the creation of this site not taught in CSE 154 thus far, which is
        mostly just SVG features, were learned nearly exclusively from MDN, along with some
        auxiliary Stack Overflow queries upon error messages.
